# Absolutes for this class

You need to do / not do these things for every assignment, exam, and project when applicable.

These are not ALL the rules, but these are the ones most commonly broken by previous students.

## HTML
* Do not use tables for layout
* Do not use HTML for styling/appearance
* Do not rely on the browser to fix mistakes

## CSS
* Do not use inline CSS
* Do not use `float` to position items (instead, use flexbox (google it) or `display: inline-block`
* Do not use explicit height/width when you can instead let it automatic decide based on content

## JS
* Use const whenever you can.  No really.
