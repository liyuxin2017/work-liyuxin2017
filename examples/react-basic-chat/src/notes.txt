1) Convert everything to REact
- don't put non-view logic into your JSX - keep them separate and import
- Pass state variables down as props
- Pass handlers to change state down as props
2) Display error message in the app.


Step 1:

Have Message list, list of active users, and a message input/button to send that doesn't do anything yet all in JSX
- Remember to have a different file with a .jsx extension for each component
- Keep your components small
- import local componants/files starting with "./" otherwise it will look for a library of that name
- If using a class-based component you much explicitly bind any methods used as a callback that also use "this" 
- If using a function-based component it is convenient to use object destructuring to get individual passed properties
- You must use a class-based component if using this.state for that component (but you generally want to limit the number of components that is true for)
