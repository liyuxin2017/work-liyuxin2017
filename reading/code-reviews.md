# Code Reviews

## What is a Code Review?

A Code Review is when one or more people examine your actual code and ask questions, point out problems and concerns, and make suggestions.  Code Reviews are often done before a code change is merged into codebase that is used for production deployment, possibly requiring one or more reviewers to "approve" your changes.

A Code Review is one of the best opportunities to expand your practical programming expertise from mentors, peers, and in my case, students.  That learning goes both ways.  

## Why Code Review?

A Code Review is **not** anyone telling you what in your code is "wrong".  That can happen, but more often code reviews are used to share approaches, increase understanding, and improve the general maintainability of the code (See also the "Maintainability" document).  Code Reviews are not themselves a "grade" and most programming professional working with others on coding projects gets a code review before changes are merged.

## I had a terrible code review!?

Remember that the value in Code Reviews is when you get comments.  Also remember that the language used in code review comments are more terse and stern than when in-person.
