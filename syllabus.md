This course covers Javascript for Web Development, focusing on the architectural implications of a rapidly evolving platform that has frequent requirement and environment changes. Students will learn to learn Javascript, recent language upgrades (ES6/ES7), security best practices, JSON, making AJAX requests, authorization and authentication, calling REST services, Single Page Applications (SPA), “Serverless” applications (using FaaS), NodeJS to provide JS on the server, and using the React library as examples of approaches to front end architecture.  Students will be expected to complete and extend several personal and small group projects using the skills covered in class.
